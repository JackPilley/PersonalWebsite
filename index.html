                    <p>Made with: C++, Win32 API</p>
                    <p>Snippy is a very simple screenshot program. It was created using only the Win32 API. I made it to help me reference past slides
                        while watching lecture recordings.</p>

                    <p>Made with: Java, Spigot, SQLite</p>
                    <p>A custom game mode for Minecraft servers using Spigot. Players were provided a plot of land in a safe world where PVP was disabled and
                        had to venture into PVP enabled zones to collect building supplies. The plugin handled land management, score tracking, and
                        economy services.</p>

                    <p>Project Cyan was an alternate reality game (ARG) that took place over several events. Players had to work together to solve
                        complex puzzles to access the internal network of the ill-fated Cyan Research Company. The game was played through a YouTube live
                        stream chat. Players would send commands and the stream would react automatically.</p>

                    <p>Charcoal was a game played through a Discord bot. Players each controlled a tank that could move around on the game board and shoot at
                        other players. Every action consumed an action point and players received a single action point every 12 hours. To encourage teamwork, players
                        could transfer their points to anyone in range.</p>

                    <p>Oxblood was a game played through a Discord bot. Based on the card game Coup, players were assigned random roles. No one role
                        could accomplish anything on its own, so players quickly formed alliances and attempted to eliminate other groups.</p>
