                <h2>Snippy</h2>
                <p>Snippy is a very simple screenshot program. It was created using only the Win32 API. I made it to help me reference past slides
                    while watching lecture recordings.</p>
                <p>The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/JackPilley/Snippy">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Business Card Raytracer</h2>
                <p>A minimal raytracing program that can fit on the back of a business card. I created it during the winter 2022 break.</p>
                <p>The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/JackPilley/BusinessCardRayTracer">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>The Door Museum</h2>
                <p>A Stanley Parable type game created for the 101 Hours game jam. The theme was "doors." Our game won 4th place out of 30 total entries.</p>
                <p>The game can be played <a href="https://morganf.itch.io/the-door-museum">here</a> (I recommend downloading it, the web player is a bit buggy).</p>

                <h2>HG Minecraft Manager</h2>
                <p>A custom game mode for Minecraft servers using Spigot. Players were provided a plot of land in a safe world where PVP was disabled and
                   had to venture into PVP enabled zones to collect building supplies. The plugin handled land management, score tracking, and
                   economy services.</p>

                <h2>Project Cyan</h2>
                <p>Project Cyan was an alternate reality game (ARG) that took place over several events. Players had to work together to solve
                complex puzzles to access the internal network of the ill-fated Cyan Research Company. The game was played through a YouTube live
                stream chat. Players would send commands and the stream would react automatically.</p>
                <p>An archive of the most recent event can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jmKm3oaPg">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Oxblood</h2>
                <p>Oxblood was a game played through a Discord bot. Based on the card game Coup, players were assigned random roles. No one role
                could accomplish anything on its own, so players quickly formed alliances and attempted to eliminate other groups.</p>
                <p>The bot is no longer running, but the manual can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7BaydSPeyF09-qxUWtTDnw6U4NUcaEb9ggyHlLozpk">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Charcoal</h2>
                <p>Charcoal was a game played through a Discord bot. Players each controlled a tank that could move around on the game board and shoot at
                other players. Every action consumed an action point and players received a single action point every 12 hours. To encourage teamwork, players
                could transfer their points to anyone in range.</p>
                <p>The bot is not longer running, but the manual can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NC-mYTqNdJnD5diqTQ4BneUSHrKPMW10wrc7Hkojo8U">here</a>.</p>
