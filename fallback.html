                <p>Snippy is a very simple screenshot program. It was created using only the Win32 API. I made it to help me reference past slides

                <h2>HG Minecraft Manager</h2>
                <p>Made with: Java, Spigot, SQLite</p>
                <p>A custom game mode for Minecraft servers using Spigot. Players were provided a plot of land in a safe world where PVP was disabled and
                    had to venture into PVP enabled zones to collect building supplies. The plugin handled land management, score tracking, and
                    economy services.</p>

                <p>Made with: Javascript, YouTube Data API V3</p>
                <p>Project Cyan was an alternate reality game (ARG) that took place over several events. Players had to work together to solve
                    complex puzzles to access the internal network of the ill-fated Cyan Research Company. The game was played through a YouTube live
                    stream chat. Players would send commands and the stream would react automatically.</p>

                <p>Charcoal was a game played through a Discord bot. Players each controlled a tank that could move around on the game board and shoot at
                    other players. Every action consumed an action point and players received a single action point every 12 hours. To encourage teamwork, players
                    could transfer their points to anyone in range.</p>

                <p>Made with: Typescript, Discord API</p>
                <p>Oxblood was a game played through a Discord bot. Based on the card game Coup, players were assigned random roles. No one role
                    could accomplish anything on its own, so players quickly formed alliances and attempted to eliminate other groups.</p>

                <p>I created the background of this website using WebGL2. The models were made in Blender 3D and the materials were made in Substance Designer. Unfortunately it didn't load for you.
                Your browser or device probably doesn't support WebGL2.</p>
